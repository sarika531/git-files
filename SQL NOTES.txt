STORED PROCEDURES:


A stored procedure is a prepared sql code that you can save , sothe code can be resuses over aand over again\\

so,if you have an sql query that you can write over and overagain, save it as a stored procedure , and then just call it to excecute it

you can also pass parmaters to a stored procedured sothat the stores procedure can act based o the paramater vale(S) that is passaes

stored procedure synatx:

CREATE PROCEDURE PROCEDURE_NAME
AS
ASL_STATEMENT
GO;

Execute stored procedures

EXCc producure_name;


let us take an example of stored procedure:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Address	City	PostalCode	Country
1

Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Obere Str. 57	Berlin	12209	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	Ana Trujillo	Avda. de la Constitución 2222	México D.F.	05021	Mexico
3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	Antonio Moreno	Mataderos 2312	México D.F.	05023	Mexico
4

Around the Horn	Thomas Hardy	120 Hanover Sq.	London	WA1 1DP	UK
5	Berglunds snabbköp	Christina Berglund	Berguvsvägen 8	Luleå	S-958 22	Sweden





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for suppose  we have table like this how to implement on this table:

create procedure Selectallcustomers
as
select*from customer
go;

execution of stored procedure:

EXEC seelectallcustomers;


this selects all records from the customer table

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stored procedure with one parameter let us take an example:

create procedure selectallcustomers @city nvarchar(20)
as
select*from customer where city =@city
go;

EXEC selectallcustomers @city ='london';

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stored procedures with multiple parametrs:

create procedure selectallcustomers @city nvarchar(20),@postalcode navarchar(10)

as
select*from customer where city=@city and postalcode=@postalcode
go;

exec selectalllcustomers @city ='london', @postalcode='wal 1dp';

-----------------------------------------------------------------
